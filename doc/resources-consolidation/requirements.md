# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nathan Learning Website currently consists of multiple mini-websites for different learning topics (time-and-clock, basic-calculation) with plans for future expansion. Each mini-website currently maintains its own CSS files and resource structure, leading to code duplication and inconsistent styling. This project aims to consolidate shared resources like CSS, icons, and images into a centralized structure that all mini-websites can utilize, improving maintainability and ensuring visual consistency across the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Nathan Learning Website, I want all mini-websites to share common CSS and resources, so that I can maintain consistent styling and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new mini-website is created THEN it SHALL use the shared CSS framework without needing custom styles for basic components
2. WHEN common styles are updated THEN all mini-websites SHALL automatically reflect the changes
3. WHEN shared resources are modified THEN the changes SHALL be applied consistently across all learning topics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized assets directory structure, so that icons, images, and other resources can be shared efficiently across all mini-websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are needed by multiple mini-websites THEN they SHALL be stored in a shared location accessible to all
2. WHEN new assets are added THEN they SHALL follow the established shared directory structure
3. WHEN assets are referenced THEN the path SHALL be consistent across all mini-websites

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the learning website, I want consistent visual design across all learning topics, so that the experience feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between different learning topics THEN the visual design SHALL maintain consistency in colors, fonts, and layout patterns
2. WHEN using common UI components (buttons, navigation, cards) THEN they SHALL have identical styling across all mini-websites
3. WHEN viewing the website on different devices THEN responsive behavior SHALL be consistent across all learning topics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve existing functionality while implementing the shared resources, so that no features are broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality in time-and-clock SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality in basic-calculation SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN CSS is consolidated THEN no visual regressions SHALL occur in any mini-website

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer adding new learning topics, I want a clear structure and guidelines for using shared resources, so that new mini-websites can be developed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new mini-website THEN there SHALL be clear documentation on how to use shared resources
2. WHEN shared CSS classes are available THEN they SHALL be documented with usage examples
3. WHEN the shared structure is established THEN it SHALL accommodate future mini-websites without requiring structural changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer creating new mini-websites, I want a comprehensive layout design guide in the doc folder, so that I can ensure consistent layout and styling across all learning topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new mini-website is being developed THEN there SHALL be a markdown file in the doc folder describing the standard layout patterns
2. WHEN the layout guide is created THEN it SHALL include visual examples, CSS class references, and HTML structure templates
3. WHEN developers reference the layout guide THEN they SHALL be able to implement consistent header, navigation, content areas, and responsive behavior
4. WHEN the layout guide is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the current shared CSS framework and component library

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain topic-specific customizations while using shared resources, so that each learning topic can have unique elements when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mini-website needs topic-specific styling THEN it SHALL be able to extend or override shared styles without affecting other topics
2. WHEN shared resources are used THEN topic-specific assets SHALL still be supported in dedicated directories
3. WHEN customizations are needed THEN they SHALL follow a clear hierarchy that prioritizes shared styles but allows overrides
